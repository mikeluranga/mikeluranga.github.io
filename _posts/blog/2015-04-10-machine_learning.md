As an aspiring data scientist I am constantly trying to improve my skills. Recently I have taken a [SQL course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/SQL/SelfPaced/about) and now I am moving on to gain more knowledge on Machine Learning. I have quite a strong background on Applied Econometrics but I have noticed that Econometrics and Machine Learning, despite sharing many common techniques and concepts, do not share a common terminology. <!--more-->Depending who you are talking to, this can be an obstacle in some discussions about problem solving. 

My approach to become more familiar with Machine Learning language and its applications was to enroll and complete all the assignments in the [Machine Learning module offered by Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/outline?module=vBJVZ). However I have realised that this version of the course does not include any recommended lectures, and not even the notes! My experience after taking some online courses on data science is that after some time I have usually found myself going back to those courses materials. The instructor in this course, [Andrew NG](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ang/), also teaches a Machine Learning course in Stanford where he provides his students some [notes and problems](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html).

Once I will be done with this course I am very likely to take this one by [Tom Mitchell](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10701_sp11/lectures.shtml) although at first sight it seems more advanced material, with a special focus on Bayesian analysis.
