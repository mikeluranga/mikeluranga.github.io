This post is the first of a series of blog posts about useful R packages that make your life as an analyst easier. R is a very powerful tool, but when it comes to data manipulation, things sometimes get a bit tricky. Dplyr is a package that aims to make this sort of processes more intuitive with a few functions with pretty informative names.<!--more-->

First thing we need to do is to load Dplyr along with one of the built in datasets in R. In this case we are using `ChickWeight`, a database included in R for practizing ([+ Info](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/ChickWeight.html)).


{% highlight r %}
# install.packages("dplyr",repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
library(dplyr)
mydf <- ChickWeight
{% endhighlight %}

Now data is assigned to a R data frame, however as we are going to work with dplyr, the first step is to load data in a 'data frame tbl'. 

{% highlight r %}
mydf_tb <- tbl_df(mydf)
mydf_tb #print data frame tbl
{% endhighlight %}

## 1      42    0     1    1

## ..    ...  ...   ...  ...

##Select 

The first function to review is Select. Basically, it permits us to select only those columns in the dataset that we are interested in and place them in the order we want them to appear.


{% highlight r %}
columns_subset <- select(mydf_tb,Chick,weight,Time) #Select three first columns and rearrange
columns_subset
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Source: local data frame [578 x 3]
## 
##    Chick weight Time
## 1      1     42    0
## 2      1     51    2
## 3      1     59    4
## 4      1     64    6
## 5      1     76    8
## 6      1     93   10
## 7      1    106   12
## 8      1    125   14
## 9      1    149   16
## 10     1    171   18
## ..   ...    ...  ...
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r %}
columns_subset2 <- select(mydf_tb, -Diet) #Alternatively we can select all columns in mydf_tb except Diet
columns_subset2 <- select(mydf_tb, weight:Chick) #We can obtain the same result as in the previous command by using the interval operator ':'
{% endhighlight %}

It is important to note that when using dplyr functions it is not necessary to write `dataframe$columnname` to access a column as we normally would. 

##Filter

Usually after selecting some columns from the original dataset we are only interested in some of the observations. Subsetting rows is easy with filter() function. 


{% highlight r %}
filter(mydf_tb, Time == 0) #This subset collects only data of chicks weight at birth
filter(mydf_tb, Time <= 6 & Diet==1) #This subset collects only data of chicks following diet 1 when they are 6 days old or younger.
mydf_tb <- filter(mydf_tb, !is.na(weight)) #This select only those rows that have no missing values (NA) in the weight variable. 
{% endhighlight %}

##Arrange

Arrange function is very handy to change the order of the rows of a dataset according to the values of one or more variables. It can also make use of ascending and descending order of different variables.


{% highlight r %}
arrange(mydf_tb, desc(weight)) #This chunk sorts the data table in descending order by weight, so we'll get the heaviest first.
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Source: local data frame [578 x 4]
## 
##    weight Time Chick Diet
## 1     373   21    35    3
## 2     361   20    35    3
## 3     341   21    34    3
## 4     332   18    35    3
## 5     331   21    21    2
## 6     327   20    34    3
## 7     322   21    48    4
## 8     321   21    40    3
## 9     318   20    21    2
## 10    309   21    29    2
## ..    ...  ...   ...  ...
{% endhighlight %}

##Mutate

This function helps in the creation of variables based on already existing variables in the database.


{% highlight r %}
mutate(mydf_tb, weight_kg = weight/1000) #This code creates a new variable weight_kg where weight is measured in kgs instead of gr.
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Source: local data frame [578 x 5]
## 
##    weight Time Chick Diet weight_kg
## 1      42    0     1    1     0.042
## 2      51    2     1    1     0.051
## 3      59    4     1    1     0.059
## 4      64    6     1    1     0.064
## 5      76    8     1    1     0.076
## 6      93   10     1    1     0.093
## 7     106   12     1    1     0.106
## 8     125   14     1    1     0.125
## 9     149   16     1    1     0.149
## 10    171   18     1    1     0.171
## ..    ...  ...   ...  ...       ...
{% endhighlight %}

##Summarize
Use summarize to collapse data. For instance we might be interested in the average weight in kg of the chickens.

{% highlight r %}
summarize(mydf_tb, mean(weight))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Source: local data frame [1 x 1]
## 
##   mean(weight)
## 1     121.8183
{% endhighlight %}

However, it seems more interesting gain some insight into the average chicken weight by Diet. 

##Group_by
This function breaks up data into groups of rows based on one or more variables

{% highlight r %}
by_diet <- group_by(mydf_tb, Diet) #Group by type of diet and store it in by_diet
summarize(by_diet, mean(weight)) #Now if we pass summarize function to by_diet we will obtain mean values of chicken weight by diet
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Source: local data frame [4 x 2]
## 
##   Diet mean(weight)
## 1    1     102.6455
## 2    2     122.6167
## 3    3     142.9500
## 4    4     135.2627
{% endhighlight %}
